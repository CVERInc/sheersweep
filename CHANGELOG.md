## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0]

- First slice: the honest, readable Mac cleaner.
- Sweeps **every account** under `/Users` (current and future): `Library/Caches`,
  `Library/Logs`, `~/.cache`, `~/.npm`, Xcode `DerivedData`/`DeviceSupport`,
  CoreSimulator caches, Cargo/Gradle caches, leftover Adobe caches/support.
- System-wide: `/Library/Caches`, `/.adobeTemp`, `brew cleanup` (run as the real
  user, never root).
- Releases local APFS (Time Machine) snapshots so freed space actually returns.
- `--dry-run` previews every item's size and deletes nothing.
- Hard never-touch list (photos, documents, app data, Clip Studio, cloud sync,
  repos, vaults). The only delete call runs solely on the listed cache paths.
- Re-execs with `sudo` to sweep all accounts; `--version` / `--help` need no sudo.
